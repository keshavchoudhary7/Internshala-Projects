What I learned from this project:
A. HTML Structure: learned how to structure a basic HTML document, including the <head>, <body>, and various elements within them.

B. Semantic HTML: I used semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, and <fieldset> to structure my content logically and meaningfully.

C. Embedding Media: learned how to embed images and videos into HTML document using the <img> and <iframe> tags, respectively.

D. Hyperlinks and Anchor Tags: I used anchor tags <a> to create hyperlinks for navigation within the blog and to external resources.

E. Meta Tags: I included various meta tags for defining document metadata like character set, viewport settings, keywords, author information, and description.

F. Google Drive Embedding: learned how to embed videos hosted on Google Drive into the webpage using iframe tags.

I. Content Organization: I have structured blog content logically with separate sections for navigation, blog posts, about me, and contact information.

J. Document Validation: It's important to validate the HTML document using services like the W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure it follows correct syntax and standards.

Thanks Internshala for the guidance and this is just begining.
